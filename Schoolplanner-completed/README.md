# Schoolplanner

Schoolplaner functions as a checklist for students studying for exams. Simply enter into the app homework to complete, office hours to attend, and exams to sit (for example) and Schoolplaner will handle them for you. As you approach the deadline of a task, the app will notify you. Once you complete a task, Schoollanner will check it off.
